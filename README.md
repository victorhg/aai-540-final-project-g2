## Objective
This project aims to use deep learning technologies to recognize the emotions from voice interactions. As a possible extra activity in the project, We would like to explore the possibility of having a model trained on a single language dataset being tested for multiple languages, understanding how predicted emotions compare in feature information and overall similarity.



### Project Introduction

Speech Emotion Recognition can be an incredible tool, used during interaction between human to human (H2H), human to machine(H2M), and Machine to Machine (M2M),  attempting to recognize emotion and affective states from speech. 

Human voice, through tone, pitch and velocity, often reflects underlying emotions and can convey a lot of context during interactions. Even animals are equipped with capabilities to recognize emotions from voice and general human expressions. 

As part of speech recognition, this aspect is incredibly important for systems that can deal with humans in a variety of situations: 
- telemarketing and customer service
- shopping assistants
- emergency response 
- patient care and health advice

Analyzing voice features to identify changes in emotions can be an important tool to prevent interactions from escalating, allowing a better understanding of situational context that can impact action planning in professional services settings.  

## Technical Details

There are a few datasets available from known dataset that we can use to train our model:

- Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset (Crema-D)
- Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (Ravdess)
- Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (Savee)
- Toronto emotional speech set (Tess)
